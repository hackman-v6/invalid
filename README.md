TerraDapp is a React.js web application designed to facilitate decentralized crowdfunding for environmental crisis campaigns. It empowers users to submit their needs and make donations using web3 wallets like MetaMask. The application incorporates Supabase Authentication for hybrid storage and leverages a smart contract deployed on the Polygon Mumbai network. Additionally, we've implemented Polygon ID for identity verification, ensuring the integrity of campaigns and preventing illegal activities.
