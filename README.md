<h1>Team Invalid - TerraDapp, Decentralised Crowdfunding for environmental crisis Web Application</h1>
<p>We are developing a React JS website with Material UI for styling. It incorporates Supabase Authentication for hybrid storage and a Smart contract deployed on Polygon Mumbai. Our platform aims to facilitate environmental crisis campaigns, allowing users to submit their needs. Additionally, users can make donations through their preferred web3 wallets like metamask. To ensure integrity and prevent illegal activities, we tried implementing Polygon ID for identity verification, similar to KYC.</p>
